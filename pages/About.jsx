      <h3>What is Wild Swimming</h3>
      <p>
        Wild swimming is simply swimming – or just taking a dip – in any of
        nature’s watering holes.
      </p>
      <h3>Health Benefits of Wild Swimming</h3>
      <p>
        The health and psychological benefits of dipping in natural waters have
        long been known, as our many spa towns are testament to. Florence
        Nightingale and Charles Dicken both claimed to have been cured by these
        traditional forms of ‘hydrotherapy’. There are quite a few different
        physiological and health effects: First, a one off dunk creates intense
        vasodilation, pumping out muscle lactates, and bringing fresh blood to
        the extremities.
      </p>

        Second, a cold dip also provides a psychological kick start too. A
        powerful endorphin shot is released and this natural high bringing on
        intense feelings of well being and an addictive urge to dive back in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Third, after regular swimming, a process known as cold adaptation kicks
        in. Not only does this reduce your body’s sensation of coldness (making
        even the coldest water quite pleasant), it is clinically proven to boost
        mode, libido and the immune system – as shown in NASA experiments from
        the 1980s. Coldwater swimming is also a sure-fire way to burn calories
        quickly and building muscle tone and graceful technique.
      </p>
      <p>
        People also explain that wild swimming is a very good way to de-stress,
        and acts like a form of mindfulness or meditation, bringing them into
        the moment, focusing their mind on the physical sensations, and taking
        them away from their worries and concerns. In some ways it is the
        perfect digital detox. Wild swimming appeals to a wide range of people,
        from local teenagers who have always enjoyed mucking about in the
        rivers, to octogenarians who find it keeps them healthy and alert. But
        there is also a growing cadre of more middle aged city dwellers who
        might have might have discovered it from books and newspaper about wild
        swimming, or from joining a triathlon.
